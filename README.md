## Air Quality Index (AQI) Analysis

This repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks focused on analyzing Air Quality Index (AQI) data to assess pollution trends and identify patterns that may help in environmental and public health monitoring.

### Notebooks

1. **Daily AQI Analysis.ipynb**

   * Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on daily AQI values.
   * Analyzes pollutant-specific data (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, and O3).
   * Includes visualizations such as line plots, histograms, and correlation heatmaps.
   * Identifies pollution trends over time and across different seasons.

2. **AQI\_Analysis.ipynb**

   * Provides a detailed breakdown of AQI levels across different cities or monitoring stations.
   * Applies statistical analysis to summarize AQI distributions.
   * Includes boxplots, bar charts, and AQI categorization analysis.
   * Offers insights into the most and least polluted areas.

### Features

* Utilizes Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for data manipulation and visualization.
* Aids in understanding the temporal and spatial distribution of air pollutants.
* Supports informed decision-making regarding air quality control policies.
